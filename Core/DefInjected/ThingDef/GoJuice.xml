  <!-- EN: A synthetic performance-enhancing drug developed for space marines during the early days of interplanetary warfare. Go-juice blocks pain, increases movement speed, and improves the user's melee and shooting abilities.\n\nMilitary chemists who created it were never able to remove its addictiveness. Some saw this as a downside; others saw it as a benefit. -->
  <GoJuice.description>Et prestasjonsfremmende stoff laget for romsoldater i romkrigenes yngre dager. Hyperjuice demper smerte, øker bevegelsesevnen, og bedrer generelle kampferdigheter.\n\nDen avhengighetsdannende effekten ble aldri fjernet. Noen kaller det en bivirkning – andre kaller det en fordel.</GoJuice.description>
