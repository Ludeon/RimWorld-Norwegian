Google Spreadsheet for translation progress: On hold?

# Update for April 2016
There is a ton of stuff that needs translation, and not only that: Some source strings have changed. There are about 500 000 characters total for the entire game, which converts to about 100 pages. So, we could really need 3-5 active contributors!

Coming:
- Term list - for those terms that are repeated in many places
- Progress list - To make it easier for someone to grab something untranslated

###Translators:

- Darky
- ApertureAlex
- TheUnknownKiller
- IllusionDistort
- 2villa1
- TheSettker95
- EirikBirkeland
