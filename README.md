Google Spreadsheet for translation progress: On hold?

# Update for April 2016
There is a ton of stuff that needs translation, and not only that: Some source strings have changed. I'm currently going through the /Keyed folder (about 20% of the game). There are about 500 000 characters total now, or about 100 pages. So, we could really need 3-5 active contributors!

###Translators:

- Darky
- ApertureAlex
- TheUnknownKiller
- IllusionDistort
- 2villa1
- TheSettker95
- EirikBirkeland
